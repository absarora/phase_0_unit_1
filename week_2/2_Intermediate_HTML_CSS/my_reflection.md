# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
```
I believe that web standards are a must for it makes it easier for the third person to read your  
code. Also, using web standards will allow websites to display your information correctly.    
```
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?  
```
I am a newbie to HTML5 and I am still working to get my head around the correct use of semantic  
elements, especially the 'sectioning' content: section, aside, and article.    
```
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
```
Yes, I definitely like HTML5 elements better for it ease my work load of working with divs, ids,  
and classes.  
```
* Why is reset.css necessary?  
```
To make sure that your website looks the same in any browser.  
```
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
```
I have used Mozilla, Chrome, Safari, Opera, and IE. Yes, I have realized that there is a minor difference  
in the way websites appear in different browsers since every browser has their own default stylesheet to  
make any unstyled websites look more readable. Doing so seems appropriate for they would want the user to  
like or rather choose their web browser as their default browser.  
```
