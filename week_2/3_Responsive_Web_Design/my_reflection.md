# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
```
Responsive Web Design is a combination of fluid grids and layouts, and CSS media queries.
It, surely, is a good practice to use responsive web design to make sure the website adjusts
smartly according to the media it is viewed in.  
```
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
```
Smartphones, tablets, desktops, laptops, or any form of media has a different layout screen
and in order to account for our web design in any of the media being used, we must use
responsive web design for the website or the web app to adjust according to the screen size.  
```
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and develop for them?
```
People who are visually impaired rely on screen readers to use the web. Yes, we should definitely
design and develop for them.  
```
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
```
I found the topic, Responsive Web Design very fascinating and I would like to study
more on it. I did learn that I must convert pixels to ems, use relative widths for my
website, and use CSS media queries to account for a successful responsive web design.  
```
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
