# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
```
DOM is an API for HTML and XML documents where programmers can build documents, navigate  
their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.
```
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
```
wordpress.com is comparatively more organized with lots of comments and a well structured DOM
which makes it easier for a third person to read the code.  
```
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
```
Chrome Web Tools is a life saver; it is an extremely powerful and a helpful tool for debugging
issues within HTML, CSS, Javascript, and/or jQuery. Besides debugging, it is great tool for
optimizing your website through network performance, frames, memory, and pageSpeed.
```
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
```
I surely had an "aha" moment as I finished the tutorial on Chrome Web Tools. 90 % of the things I
learned were new to me.
```
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.  
```
No, I did not.
