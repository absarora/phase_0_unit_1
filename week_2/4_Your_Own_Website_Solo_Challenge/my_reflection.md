# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: [absarora.github.io](absarora.github.io)

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
```
Within Design, one must learn to have a flow, create a layout, search and bookmark things that
you found interesting and may want to use it later for your project. User experience is making
sure to build an intuitive, simple, and a beautiful design that would delight the user everytime
they visit your website. As Google says, "Focus on the user and all else will follow."
```
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
```
Yes, I did like the systematic approach to design and user experience. It makes it easier
to build a website if we have a plan and have our wireframes ready for each page of the
website or an app.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
```
Have a plan and create the wireframes.
```
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
```
At present, the website only provides information about DBC: Phase 0. Next step
is to change my index page to my personal page and link all my projects beneath
it where DBC would be one of the categories rather being the only page.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
```
No, it wasn't difficult to apply the material learned.
```
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
```
No, I did not.
```
