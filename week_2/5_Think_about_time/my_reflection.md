# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
```
My biggest time management challenge for me is that I get overwhelmed with the things I have to get
done in so little time.  
```
* How will you combat that? 
```
I must learn to prioritize things and schedule myself for the day.
```
* What techniques will you try?
```
1. Get my sleeping pattern right.
2. Have a schedule set for the next day.
```
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
```
My overall plan for Phase 0 is to learn as much as possible from the mentors, the June Bugs, and the Coyote family.  
```
